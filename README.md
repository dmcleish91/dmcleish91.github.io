Welcome to Dwight's Java Portfolio! Below are some of the applications that I have created/worked on using Java!

## 1. Coronavirus Tracker App

This project was created using **Spring Boot**. 

This application parses a CSV file to a database and uses the Thymeleaf dependancy to format then display the data to a website.
